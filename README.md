# Jabber+ #

A rip-off of Google+ only in name. This repository stores some custom emoticons for the Cisco Jabber chat client. Anyone should feel free to contribute! Makes Jabber a little more fun. :beers:

## Installing ##

On Windows the recomended way to install custom emoticons is to navigate to the folder at `%appdata%\Roaming\Cisco\Unified Communication\Jabber\CSF\CustomEmoticons` and replace its contents with the files in this repository.

On other platforms, find the Jabber installation directory and look for the `CustomEmoticons` directory.

After replacing the contents of the `CustomEmoticons` directory restart Jabber.

The emoticons should now appear in the emoticon menu inside chat windows.

## Contributing ##

* Fork this repository. (optional)

* Clone/Download this repo.

* Add the desired emoticon as a PNG and edit the `emoticonDefs.xml` file appropriately.

* Submit a pull request.

## Tips ##

Try to keep all PNGs named in a sane manner, and do not use capitals. Windows/OSX doesn't always discriminate between capital letters in filenames so this could cause problems for supporting multiple platforms.

Keep PNGs to a reasonable size, otherwise using that emoticon will simply stretch beyond the default chat window size. Most emoticons won't need to be larger than 100px by 100px.
